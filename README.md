# Guillotine Cuts
This repository contains all code written for my Bachelor's Thesis at IIIT-Delhi. Currently we are trying to enumerate optimal cut sequences for Axis Parallel Rectangles.

## Guide 

### /ref
This folder contains all the proof of concept code. This code will not be run directly for enumeration but it is simply for ironing out implementation details, and to help decide structure of more low level code.
